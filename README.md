## Overview of the project
## Overview of the Project

### Project: Simple Calculator

### Objective
Provide Basic Arithmetic Operations:

Allow users to perform basic mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User Interaction:

Prompt users to input two numbers.
Enable users to select the desired operation from a set of options.
Perform Calculations Dynamically:

Process the selected operation in real time based on the user’s inputs.
Error Handling:

Handle invalid inputs such as division by zero gracefully.
Ensure the user is informed when an invalid operation is selected.
Educational Value:

Serve as an introductory programming exercise for understanding conditional statements, user input handling, and basic arithmetic operations in Java.

### Key Activities:
Key Activities in the Simple Calculator Program:
Accept User Input:

Prompt the user to input two numerical values.
Request the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Display Operation Choices:

Present a menu with numbered options for available operations.
Validate User Choice:

Ensure the user's choice corresponds to a valid operation (e.g., 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
Perform Calculations:

Use a control structure (e.g., switch statement) to perform the selected mathematical operation based on the user’s choice.
Handle Errors:

Check for division by zero and handle it gracefully.
Provide feedback for invalid choices or inputs.
Display Results:

Output the result of the calculation in a user-friendly format.
Show an error message if the operation cannot be completed (e.g., invalid operation, division by zero).
End the Program Gracefully:

Terminate the program after displaying the result or error message.
Optionally, prompt the user to try again (not included in the base version but can be added as an enhancement).
